In this game, players will choose a character to be their fighter. All the remaining characters will then become the player's enemies.

To attack the oponent, the player will need to click Attack. Every time the player attacks, the fighter attack power will increase. Also, every time that happens, the oponent will also counter attack.

If the fighter is able to defeat all 3 oponents, the player wins. Otherwise, the player loses.
